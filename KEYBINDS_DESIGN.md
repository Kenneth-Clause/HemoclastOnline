🎯 Design Notes

Compact Combat → Only 10 core slots (1–6, QERF). Easy for new players, enough for veterans.

Right Click = Context → Intuitive and reduces clutter (no weird “hold to turn” requirement).

Optional Click-to-Move + Autorun → Accessibility for casual/MMO audiences.

Walk/Run Toggle → Immersion + RP-friendly feature without complexity.
